### Symbolic constants ###

We need a logical way of keeping track of all of the symbolic constants. The to_lambda() function (currently in operations.py) does not integrate nicely with way we currently generate new constants to include in an expression tree. to_lambda() should probably be re-written. Also, the lambdas generated by add_constant() and mult_constant won't display correctly when printed. I think this is fixable with something like:
    
    def add_constant(symbolic_constant):
        temp = lambda x: x + symbolic constant
        temp.__name__ = "+c"
        return temp
        
### Weighted probabilistc search ###

A search strategy that may be worth exploring: define the measure of how much we 'want' to expand a certain path represented as a probability vector. Some functions are likely to appear in regression (polynomials), others (e.g. arctan) shouldn't pop up that often.
